**critic2**

Our "swiss army" software tool. Use this for:
* converting between file formats and writing input for electronic structure codes starting from molecular or crystal geometries (.cif, .res, .xyz)
* extracting single molecules, dimers, trimers, etc. from a crystal structure
* comparing crystal structures with each other, and with experimental PXRD patterns
* operations on cube files and plotting results on a line or plane
* QTAIM analysis, including Bader charges and delocalization indices
* much more
