[**critic2**](https://aoterodelaroza.github.io/critic2/) -- Our "swiss army" software tool. Use this for:
* converting between file formats and writing input for electronic structure codes starting from molecular or crystal geometries (.cif, .res, .xyz)
* extracting single molecules, dimers, trimers, etc. from a crystal structure
* comparing crystal structures with each other, and with experimental PXRD patterns
* operations on cube files and plotting results on a line or plane
* QTAIM analysis, including Bader charges and delocalization indices
* much more


[**postg**](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/postg) -- Allows use of the XDM dispersion model with the Gaussian quantum-chemistry package.


[**nciplot**](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/nciplot) -- Allows generation of NCI and ELF cube files from a wavefunction (.wfn, .wfx) file.


[**escher**](https://github.com/aoterodelaroza/escher) -- A set of octave routines for generating pretty images of molecular and crystal structures.


[**bicrystal**](https://tilaskabengele.github.io/BiCrystal/) -- Use this to build incommensurate structures of layered materials.
